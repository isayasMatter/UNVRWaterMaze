# Virtual Morris Water Maze

First introduced by Richard Morris in 1981, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task has been one of the gold standards in behavioral neuroscience to evaluate spatial learning and memory in rodents. 
Studies on human spatial learning and memory have used a virtual version of the MWM.
Briefly, the task tests the quality of the subject's spatial learning through their ability to remember the location of a hidden object in reference to distal cues that are not co-located with the hidden object. This task can be used to investigate which mechanism is more dominant during spatial navigation, path integration or landmark based navigation. 

This Unity Project contains all the assets and code used in one of our studies that investigated the effect of Field of View restriction on spatial navigation performance and it relation to gender.
